# java-websocket-game


This project is intended to be a direct Java server that serves direct to websockets that are on a lot of modern browsers. Since Java did not support native websockets until JDK 1.7, the websocket library is built manually 
is compatible with JDK 1.5 and below. Certain parts of code were borrow and modified for use with this application. 

The context of this application features a web based board game, with a randomized tiling layout (still have dead-end issues.)
